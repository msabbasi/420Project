Here is the Web Graph data from http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Stanford.html

The script datatrim.c will fetch a subset of the original data according to the command line parametre. The subset of data will only contain the nodes and the edges of which the nodes index is not greater than some value. Since the original data is quite sparse, the trimmed data might containing the nodes with index not continuous.

Please try to test your program with properate amount of data. The main concern for the size of the data is to make your program to run within a moderate amount of time on a relatively large data that the machine can handle. The reccommanded data size is that at least 1000 nodes are contained.
